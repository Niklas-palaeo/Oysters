Thoughts on PNAS Paper



* Fig. 1: shows distribution and how many sites there are

* Fig 2: Age and residuals show that environment does not play a big rol, only slightly significant at haven and Norsminde. **Our data shows that growth rates are important to fully rule out environmental conditions**

* can we talk about sedentism

  ## Intra site:

We need to look whether these sites show a gradual decrease in collection age from earlier to later periods.

* Bjørnsholm: always small and young. a bit older and faster growth rates in the lower samples. one layer in the newer samples has old ones but no increased growth rate

* Ertebølle: Used to have older+larger shells in the beginning, no change in growth rate

* Norsminde: Sizes go down, Age does slightly down, main step happening in early Neo. Growth rate decreases but not by too too much.
* Eskilsø: Sizes change much, unsure about layer order.  Main control is Age, with growth rate changing only a little. 
* Krabbesholm: mostly Neolithic, ages are variable but not too young. residuals go up and down repeatedly
* Tybrind vig and new ertebølle: no stratigraphic info
* Visborg 6814:  residuals are stable, age varies a bit in A13 at the bottom but not much
* hjarnø Sund: Sizes increase to younger periods mostly due to older shells. abandonment of site?



### No stratigraphy or one layer

* Visborg 3933: no clear stratigraphy
* dyngby I und III
* ertebølle 2815
* Brovst just layer 4
* Holmegård
* Vængesø
* Eskelund
* Haven
* Hjarnø  Vesterhoved all one layer
* Vestre Strandhalle all one layer



# ideas and things we could add to the paper

* oyster abundance or change of how oysters decline based on species frequency for some of the sites

# Ideas and thoughts

what does it mean in terms of sedentism and sedentary places? for this I need to look at the early sites or sites where we know what early occupation could have looked like.

for the influences in both age and growth rate we need to add how they change each time rather than going for non-ordered bits. They also make sense, but I need to test this more thoroughly from one layer to the next. rowwise might be the function to use?

in the intro talk more about growth rates and the impact of environment, this seems to be a big one that we need to up a bit more for making the paper more impactful. see what the other papers write about environmental impacts,
